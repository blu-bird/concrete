\section{Unlabeled Probability}

\begin{problem}
1 You throw two marbles into two buckets. Find the probability that they both land in the same bucket: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlabeled into unlabeled:  1/2 (2 scenarios: marbles in separate buckets or together)
    \item Labeled into unlabeled: 1/2 (2 scenarios: marbles in separate buckets or together)
    \item Labeled into labeled: 1/2 (4 scenarios - 2 of which include both marbles in the same bucket)
    
    \item Unlabeled into labeled: 
    
    Let's label buckets A and B. You have two indistinguishable marbles, and so there are three scenarios: marbles are in separate buckets, both marbles are in A, and both marbles in B. Therefore, you may incorrectly conclude that the probability is 2/3, when in reality it remains 1/2. The probability of marbles being in separate buckets is twice the odds that both marbles are in A. 
    \newline \newline
    This is because \textbf{probability problems are ALWAYS labeled.}
    \newline \newline
    If you label the marbles 1 and 2, there are two ways for the marbles to be in separate buckets, each as probable as any of the other scenarios: 1-A and 2-B or 1-B and 2-A. 
    
    When you are asked for the probability, always treat both the balls and urns, or marbles and buckets, as labeled into labeled. 

\end{itemize}

\end{problem}

\section{Generating Function for Catalan Numbers}

Recall:

$$C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i C_{n-1-i} $$ $$ C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

Or in other words: $C_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_i C_{n-1}$

\bigbreak

\bigbreak

\noindent
Let's find a mathematical, instead of combinatorial, formula for $C_n$:

\smallbreak

\noindent Define $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n x^n$

\medbreak


\noindent Notice that $f(x) = C_0 + C_1x + C_2x^2 + C_3x^3 + ...$

\medbreak
${f(x)}^2 = C_0^2 + (C_0C_1 + C_1C_0)x + (C_0C_2 + C_1C_1 + C_2C_0) x^2 + ...$ 

\smallbreak
$= C_1 + C_2x + C_3x^2 + C_4x^3+ ... $

\medbreak

$x{f(x)}^2 = C_1x + C_2x^2 + C_3x^3 
+ C_4x^4 + ... $

\smallbreak

$x{f(x)}^2 = f(x) - C_0 = f(x) - 1$

\smallbreak

$x{f(x)}^2 - f(x) + 1 = 0$

\smallbreak
\noindent Now, use the quadratic formula to get: 

$f(x) = \frac{1\pm \sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$

\noindent 
However, we need to express this in series notation, in order to directly know the nth coefficient.

\medbreak

\noindent Recall from p.20 of Unit 1, Section 3.2:

\smallbreak

\noindent $(1-x)^\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sum \fallfac{\frac{1}{2}}{k}}{k!} x^k$

\medbreak
$= 1 - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1}\frac{1}{4^n} x^{n+1}$

\medbreak

\noindent So, $(1-4x)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1}\frac{1}{4^n} x^{n+1}$

\smallbreak
$(1-4x)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 - 2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1}$ 

\medbreak

\noindent
Based on what we previously found, $(1-4x)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 - 2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1}$ , we know to choose the solution of $f(x) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$.

\medbreak

\noindent Now, we simplify, to get that the generating function for the Catalan Numbers is:
$$\fbox{f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1} x^n}$$
