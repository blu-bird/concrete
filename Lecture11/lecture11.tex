\section{The Triangle Problem}
Redo the triangle problem from before, but consider picking any two points at vertices between two unit triangles, and setting that to be the longest diagonal of the parallelogram. In this manner, we can see that the 

\section{Unit 2: Generating Functions}
A \textbf{generating function} of a sequence $\{ a_n \}_{n=1}^\infty$ is the function $g(x)$ s

\begin{problem}{1}
	Find the $n$th term in the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots$
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
	Clearly, we see that each term is 
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{2}
	Find a generating function for the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, $\ldots$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
By definition, we have that 
\[
		g(x) = 1x^0 + 2x^1 + 4x^2 \ldots = \frac{1}{1-2x}
\]
by the geometric series. 
\end{solution}

With this analysis, we can clearly see that generating function $g$ for the sequence $1, a, a^2, \ldots = \{ a^k \}_{k=0}$ is $\frac{1}{1-ax}$. 

Here is another example: 
\begin{problem}
	Find an explicit form for the sequence $2, 5, 13, 35, 97, \ldots$ and a generating function for this sequence. 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	By inspection, we see that this sequence is $2^n + 3^n$. Clearly, we see that 
\end{solution}
Notice that generating functions are linear, so we can 
\begin{problem}
	Consider the \textit{Fibonacci numbers}, defined by $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$, and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. Find a generating function for the Fibonacci sequence, and then derive an explicit expression for the Fibonacci numbers, \textit{Binet's Formula}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	Consider writing out this generating function $F(x)$: 
\[
	F(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 +	
\]
\end{solution}
