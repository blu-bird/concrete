One possible ``bogus solution'' to this last problem:

\begin{solution}
	Arrange the boys in a line in 5! ways, choose three of the boys to put girls to the left of, and arrange the girls in 3! ways. \textit{We then divide by 8 in order to account for the cyclicity of the table.}
\end{solution}
\newline
Recall, however, the \textbf{reason} we divided by $8$ to begin with is to divide by the size of each of the equivalence groups in the original problem when arranging people around the table. There are \textbf{not} $8$ elements in each of these equivalence groups - cyclical arrangements with a girl on the very right is not part of set that we counted. In fact, there are only $5$.
