\subsection{Remark: Unlabeled Probability}

\begin{problem}
1 You throw two marbles into two buckets. Find the probability that they both land in the same bucket: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlabeled into unlabeled:  1/2 (2 scenarios: marbles in separate buckets or together)
    \item Labeled into unlabeled: 1/2 (2 scenarios: marbles in separate buckets or together)
    \item Labeled into labeled: 1/2 (4 scenarios - 2 of which include both marbles in the same bucket)
    
    \item Unlabeled into labeled: 
    
    Let's label buckets A and B. You have two indistinguishable marbles, and so there are three scenarios: marbles are in separate buckets, both marbles are in A, and both marbles in B. Therefore, you may incorrectly conclude that the probability is 2/3, when in reality it remains 1/2. The probability of marbles being in separate buckets is twice the odds that both marbles are in A. 
    \newline \newline
    This is because \textbf{probability problems are ALWAYS labeled.}
    \newline \newline
    If you label the marbles 1 and 2, there are two ways for the marbles to be in separate buckets, each as probable as any of the other scenarios: 1-A and 2-B or 1-B and 2-A. 
    
    When you are asked for the probability, always treat both the balls and urns, or marbles and buckets, as labeled into labeled.
