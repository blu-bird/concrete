\subsection{Editing Notes}
Notes on editing: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tried to be faithful as possible to the source -- either by essentially including 
    the tex source as input or by using Mathpix to generate an approximate source and 
    modifying it to match. 
    \item Tried to keep contributions from both authors if two notes existed on a day. sometimes
    (sorry) one of them is a little more coherent than the other so I made a semi-arbitrary choice
    (mostly in favor of coherency) but also kept the names of the other authors
    \item Mondays sometimes don't exist? Don't remember why to be honest... maybe no lectures happened those days? 
    \item Some contributors' graduation years/personal information may be wrong for any number of reasons 
    -- 
    want to honor people's current identities, preferred names, etc. 
    \item 
\end{itemize}
