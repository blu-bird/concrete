\section{A Small Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Any permutation can be written as a product of transpositions.
\end{theorem}

Here are some examples: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
$\pi$ & Product of Transpositions \\ \hline 
(123)(45) & (12)(13)(45) \\
(1234) & (12)(13)(14) \\
(13)(425)(67) & (13)(42)(45)(67) \\
(12345) & (12)(13)(14)(15) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

From here, we can obtain the \textit{sign} of a permutation by the parity of the number of transpositions - if there are an even number of transpositions required, they are considered even and positive, and vice versa.
