\section{Section One}
\textbf{Problem: } How many positive divisors does the number 496 have? What about 360? \\
\textbf{Solution. } We can prime factorize 

\textbf{Remark: } 496 is a perfect number - remark about Mersenne primes - $(2^{p-1}$
\begin{theorem}
	One is the loneliest number
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Two can be as bad as one. It's the loneliest number since the number one\footnote{http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-is-the-loneliest-number-lyrics-three-dog-night.html}.
\end{proof}
