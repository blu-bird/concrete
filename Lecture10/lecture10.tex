\section{Counting Problems}
\begin{problem}{1}
Consider an equilateral triangle with side length $n$ divided up into unit triangles. How many parallelograms can be drawn along the sides of the triangle? 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
$3 \binom{n+2}{4}$. 
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{2}
$n$ mathematicians walk into a bar. They each remove their hat and toss it into a pile as they arrive. Several hours later, they leave one by one, grabbing a hat at random to face the brutal March wind. What is the probability that no mathematician received his or her own hat? 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
This asymptotically approaches $\frac{1}{e}$ as $n \to \infty$. 
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
You have a bag containing $x$ numbered marbles. You draw $n$ marbles with replacement. What is the probability that you saw exactly $k$ distinct marbles? 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
$\frac{\binom{x}{k} k! \stirii{n}{k}}{x^n}$
\end{solution}
\end{document}
